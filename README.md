# ChatApp
This repository forks ChatApp - with same file-names - but code largely rewritten, which compiles and runs with Oct 2020 versions of react native and node, etc.

Why ?
Because it's 2020 and React Native has changed a lot in the last 4 years since 2016 when @Farid Safi first released this ChatApp.

The original code no longer runs; 
If one clones and tries to run "ChatApp" - you'll get missing module errors.
Importing old modules and dependencies adds more and more bugs and compile errors.
The old ChatApp code is unusable unless one replaces older modules with newer totally different modules.

In some cases the syntax and syntactic conventions have changed - and one needs to re-think and even re-write parts of the old code.

Though this is a fork - the code in each file has been written almost from scratch by me, over a span of several weeks, as a kind of "favourite Test Harness" Hobby Project - and only now am I submitting the code to GitHub as a fork of original.

I have refactored and rewritten many things in the original - to do the same thing - but which works error free with Late October, 2020 versions of react native libraries and node.

Finally and most importantly.... Please support, thank and help Farid Safi - the guy who made GiftedChat and the guy who originally made ChatApp as a demo project; and a demo project which as I said before is among my favorite pieces of toy-code!

If in France or in EU, consider taking training from Farid's company: http://www.lereacteur.io/ ; and if someday you meet Farid, tell him Nalin says hello and thanks!!!!
